**AI-Powered Job Description Analysis for Product Manager Roles**
Overview:
As a job applicant, I want to build career intelligence by distinguishing between common and differentiating AI Product Manager skills and responsibilities across companies, enabling informed skill development decisions in a rapidly evolving AI landscape.

This project is a working prototype that helps job applicants develop career intelligence by analyzing how AI Product Manager roles are described across different companies. Job descriptions uses multiple ways to express similar expectations, making it difficult to understand what skills are truly common versus what requirements are unique or emerging.  

The project ingests multiple job descriptions as unstructured text and uses generative AI to interpret and normalize AI-related skills and responsibilities into a standardized structure. These standardized outputs make it possible to apply deterministic analysis—such as frequency and comparison—using SQL.
By separating semantic interpretation (AI) from analytical reasoning (SQL), the project enables applicants to objectively identify:
	• Core AI skills and responsibilities expected across most roles
	• Differentiating requirements that signal higher maturity or specialized needs
	• Emerging expectations related to governance, human-in-the-loop processes, and ownership
The resulting insights support informed skill development decisions, helping applicants prioritize learning efforts based on real market signals rather than anecdotal job postings.<img width="819" height="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a07f598-cd6f-4dde-96f0-85ad5b55f6a4" />

This project is a working prototype designed to explore how generative AI can be used responsibly to interpret and normalize unstructured job descriptions for analytical purposes within limited resourses to manage cost control.
**The prototype focuses on:**
 ✔ Validating the end-to-end workflow
 ✔ Demonstrating where AI adds value (language interpretation)
 ✔ Producing explainable, analysis-ready outputs
**This prototype:**
✔ Uses real job description text (manually provided)
✔ Produces real, queryable insights
✔ Demonstrates architectural decision-making
**This prototype does not:**
❌ Automate large-scale ingestion
❌ Include production-grade monitoring
❌ Optimize for performance or throughput
❌ Serve as a hiring or ranking system
