**AI-Powered Job Description Analysis for Product Manager Roles**

Overview:
This project is a working prototype to develop career intelligence from a job applicant perspective. I, as an applicant, wants to analyze job descriptions posted for a given job title, e.g.  AI Product Manager, across the companies. Job descriptions posted for the similar skillsets uses multiple ways to express similar expectations, making it difficult to articulate what required skills are common versus what skillsets  are unique or emerging and in what sector.

In this prototype, my strategy was to build and test the desried capability with zero cost. The project ingests multiple job descriptions as unstructured text and uses generative AI to interpret and normalize AI-related skills and responsibilities into a standardized structure. These standardized outputs make it possible to apply deterministic analysis—such as frequency and comparison—using SQL.
By separating semantic interpretation (AI) from analytical reasoning (SQL), the project enables applicants to objectively identify:
	• Core AI skills and responsibilities expected across most roles
	• Differentiating requirements that signal higher maturity or specialized needs
	• Emerging expectations related to governance, human-in-the-loop processes, and ownership

This project is a working prototype designed to explore how generative AI can be used responsibly to interpret and normalize unstructured job descriptions for analytical purposes within limited resourses to manage cost control.

**This prototype:**

✔ Uses real job description text (manually provided)

✔ Produces real, queryable insights

✔ Demonstrates architectural decision-making

**This prototype does not:**

❌ Automate large-scale ingestion

❌ Include production-grade monitoring

❌ Optimize for performance or throughput

❌ Serve as a hiring or ranking system
